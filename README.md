# Avatar Integration Example

This project is a demonstration of how to integrate our avatars into a website via an iframe. The example shows how to:

- **Receive Messages**: Listen for messages from the iframe (e.g., questions and images).
- **Send Messages**: Send text to the avatar for it to speak.

## Features

- **Embedded Iframe**: Loads the avatar chat widget.
- **Bidirectional Communication**: Uses `postMessage` for message exchange between the parent page and the iframe.

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/CloneByMe/n8n-avatar-agent.git

### Configure the Avatar Token:

Open the `index.html` file and replace `[YOUR_AVATAR_TOKEN]` in the iframe URL with your actual avatar token.

### Run the Example:

Open the `index.html` file in your browser (either directly or using a local web server).

## How It Works

The iframe loads the chat widget from:

https://app.clonebyme.com/chat-widget?avatar=[YOUR_AVATAR_TOKEN]

The JavaScript in the page handles:

- **Listening for Messages**: It listens for messages from the iframe and displays them in the appropriate section.
- **Sending Messages**: It sends text entered by the user to the iframe so that the avatar can speak it.
